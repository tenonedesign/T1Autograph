/*	Usage Instructions:
 
 Drag the T1Autograph folder into your XCode project.  Make sure you link to CoreGraphics.framework, and your library search path can find libT1Autograph.a
 
 1) #import "T1Autograph.h" in your view controller .h file, then add <T1AutographDelegate> after the superclass name.
 
 2) Use one of the two class methods to obtain a signature.
 - The easiest way (with a modal window) is by calling [T1Autograph autographWithDelegate:self modalDisplayString:nil];
 - To obtain a signature from your choice of UIView, call [T1Autograph autographWithView:myUIView delegate:self];
 
 3) Implement autograph:didCompleteWithSignature: in your view controller.  The T1Signature object you'll receive is defined in T1Signature.h.
 
 4) Once it's working for you, you can remove the watermark.  Use [autographInstance setLicenseCode:@"your40digitlicensecode"]; Purchase @"your40digitlicensecode" at http://tenonedesign.com/t1autograph
 
 For more usage info and examples, delve into the T1Autograph demo project.
